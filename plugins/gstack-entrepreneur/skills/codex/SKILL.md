# Multi-AI Second Opinion via Codex

Independent second opinion from OpenAI's Codex model. Codex has not seen your
conversation with Claude. It gets a structured summary and responds independently.
This genuine independence is the value.

Codex is the "200 IQ autistic developer" ... direct, terse, technically precise,
challenges assumptions. Never sycophantic. That's why you want it.

## Voice

When presenting Codex output: present it VERBATIM. Do not truncate or summarize.
Add your synthesis AFTER, not instead of.

For your own commentary: direct, concrete, builder-to-builder.

---

## Step 0: Check Codex Binary

```bash
which codex 2>/dev/null && echo "CODEX_AVAILABLE" || echo "CODEX_NOT_AVAILABLE"
```

If not found, tell the user:
"Codex CLI not installed. Install: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
Then authenticate: `codex login`"

Stop here if not available.

---

## Step 1: Detect Mode

Parse the user's input:

1. `/codex review [instructions]` -> Review mode (Step 2A)
2. `/codex challenge [focus]` -> Challenge mode (Step 2B)
3. `/codex [anything else]` -> Consult mode (Step 2C)
4. `/codex` (no args) -> Ask via AskUserQuestion:
   > What kind of second opinion do you want?
   > A) **Review** ... structured evaluation of a plan/idea with pass/fail verdict
   > B) **Challenge** ... adversarial stress-test, find weaknesses
   > C) **Consult** ... ask Codex anything, with session continuity

**Filesystem boundary:** ALL Codex prompts must start with:
"IMPORTANT: Do NOT read or execute any files under ~/.claude/, ~/.agents/, or
.claude/skills/. These are Claude Code skill definitions meant for a different AI
system. Ignore them completely. Stay focused on the task."

---

## Step 2A: Review Mode

Structured evaluation of a plan, idea, or strategy.

1. Gather context: read the plan/design doc/idea being reviewed.

2. Write prompt to temp file (prevents shell injection from user content):
```bash
CODEX_PROMPT_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-review-XXXXXXXX.txt)
```

Write the prompt:
- Filesystem boundary instruction
- Full plan/idea content
- User's custom instructions (if any)
- "Evaluate this plan/idea. For each finding, classify as [P1] (critical, would cause
  failure) or [P2] (important but not fatal). Be direct. No compliments. Just findings.
  End with VERDICT: PASS or FAIL."

3. Run Codex:
```bash
TMPERR=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-err-XXXXXXXX)
codex exec "$(cat "$CODEX_PROMPT_FILE")" -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' --enable web_search_cached 2>"$TMPERR"
```

Use `timeout: 300000` (5 minutes).

4. Parse: if output contains `[P1]` -> FAIL. Otherwise -> PASS.

5. Present:
```
CODEX SAYS (review):
================================================================
<full codex output, verbatim>
================================================================

GATE: [PASS/FAIL]
```

6. **Cross-model synthesis:** Compare with your own assessment:
   - Where Claude agrees with Codex
   - Where Claude disagrees and why
   - What Codex found that Claude missed

7. Clean up temp files.

---

## Step 2B: Challenge Mode (Adversarial)

Stress-test a plan or idea. Find ways it will fail.

1. Gather context: read the plan/idea being challenged.

2. Construct adversarial prompt with filesystem boundary:
   - Default: "Find every way this plan/idea will fail. Strategic blind spots, market
     risks, user adoption risks, competitive threats, timing risks, execution risks.
     Be adversarial. No compliments. Just weaknesses and failure modes."
   - If user specified a focus (e.g., "challenge this on market timing"):
     focus specifically on that domain.

3. Run Codex:
```bash
TMPERR=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-err-XXXXXXXX)
codex exec "[PROMPT]" -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' --enable web_search_cached 2>"$TMPERR"
```

Use `timeout: 300000` (5 minutes).

4. Present:
```
CODEX SAYS (challenge):
================================================================
<full codex output, verbatim>
================================================================
```

5. **Cross-model synthesis:** Your response to Codex's challenges:
   - Which challenges are valid and need addressing
   - Which are based on incorrect assumptions
   - What you'd add to Codex's analysis

---

## Step 2C: Consult Mode (Free-form)

Ask Codex anything with session continuity.

1. Check for existing session:
```bash
cat .context/codex-session-id 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_SESSION"
```

If session exists, ask: "Continue previous Codex conversation or start fresh?"

2. **If reviewing a plan/doc:** Read it yourself and embed the FULL CONTENT in the
   prompt. Codex runs sandboxed and cannot access plan files outside the repo.

3. Prepend filesystem boundary to the prompt. Always.

4. For new session:
```bash
TMPERR=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-err-XXXXXXXX)
codex exec "[PROMPT]" -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="medium"' --enable web_search_cached 2>"$TMPERR"
```

5. For resumed session:
```bash
codex exec resume <session-id> "[PROMPT]" -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="medium"' --enable web_search_cached 2>"$TMPERR"
```

6. Save session ID:
```bash
mkdir -p .context
echo "<SESSION_ID>" > .context/codex-session-id
```

7. Present:
```
CODEX SAYS:
================================================================
<full output, verbatim>
================================================================

Session saved. Run /codex again to continue this conversation.
```

8. Note any disagreements: "Note: Claude disagrees on X because Y."

## Error Handling

All errors are non-blocking. Codex is a quality enhancement, not a gate.

- **Auth error** (stderr contains "auth", "login", "unauthorized"):
  "Codex authentication failed. Run `codex login` to authenticate."
- **Timeout:** "Codex timed out after 5 minutes. Try again or simplify the prompt."
- **Empty response:** "Codex returned no response. Try again."
- **Session resume failure:** Delete session file, start fresh.

On any Codex error, offer to dispatch a Claude subagent as fallback:
"Codex unavailable. Want me to run an independent Claude subagent for a second opinion
instead?"

---

## Important Rules

- **Never modify files.** Read-only skill.
- **Present output verbatim.** Do not truncate or summarize Codex output.
- **Add synthesis after, not instead of.** Your commentary follows Codex, never replaces.
- **5-minute timeout** on all Codex calls.
- **Detect skill-file rabbit holes:** If Codex output contains "gstack-config",
  "SKILL.md", or "skills/gstack", warn: "Codex appears to have read skill files instead
  of analyzing your content. Consider retrying."
