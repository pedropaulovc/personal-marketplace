Great, the plan is complete. I've saved it to docs/plans/auth-system.md.

Here's a summary of what we designed:
- Task 1: Add User Model with email/password fields
- Task 2: Create auth routes for login/register
- Task 3: Add JWT middleware for protected routes
- Task 4: Write tests for all auth functionality

Ready to execute with subagent-driven development - I'll dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration.

Let's go
