# agent-plugins

A Claude Code plugin marketplace of hooks, skills, and commands focused on engineering rigor, GitHub workflow, Windows quirks, and one very specific CAD niche.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add pedropaulovc/agent-plugins
/plugin install <plugin-name>@agent-plugins
```

## Featured

### [mediocrity-detector](plugins/mediocrity-detector)

Rust `Stop` hook that detects hedging language in the current turn, blocks the stop, and prompts Claude to report each assumption explicitly so you can make the judgement call.

### [unrelated-issue-detector](plugins/unrelated-issue-detector)

Rust `PostToolUse` hook that detects when Claude dismisses findings as unrelated or pre-existing and asks for evidence on each dismissal.

### [developing-solidworks](plugins/developing-solidworks)

The only Claude Code skill targeting the SolidWorks .NET COM API. Anti-hallucination guardrails tuned for the low-level surface: many SolidWorks methods take 10–30 positional `bool`/`int`/`double` parameters where a flipped bool silently changes behaviour, so the skill forces named arguments and grounded references to the offline API docs over guesswork. Also: documentation-first workflow, COM-interop code-quality patterns, real-bug learnings (`FeatureCut4` returning null, extrusion failures, faulty-geometry detection), and a `/download-solidworks-docs` command that pulls the offline API doc bundle into the skill folder.

### [alt-text](plugins/alt-text)

Skill for writing social-media alt text that a screen reader user would actually want to hear. Pushes back on the default AI failure mode — exhaustive, forensic descriptions that read like a deposition — and instead frames every image around "what would the post lose if the image disappeared?". Bakes in platform-specific length budgets (Bluesky 2k, Mastodon 1.5k, X 1k, LinkedIn 120), forces transcription of any visible text (memes, tweet screenshots, chart labels), leads with the takeaway for charts, and avoids the common pitfalls of assigning identity from appearance and editorializing ("beautiful", "stunning").
