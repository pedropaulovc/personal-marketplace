# personal-marketplace

A Claude Code plugin marketplace of hooks, skills, and commands focused on engineering rigor, GitHub workflow, Windows quirks, and one very specific CAD niche.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add pedropaulovc/personal-marketplace
/plugin install <plugin-name>@personal-marketplace
```

## Featured

### [mediocrity-detector](plugins/mediocrity-detector)

Rust `Stop` hook that detects hedging language in the current turn, blocks the stop, and prompts Claude to report each assumption explicitly so you can make the judgement call.

### [unrelated-issue-detector](plugins/unrelated-issue-detector)

Rust `PostToolUse` hook that detects when Claude dismisses findings as unrelated or pre-existing and asks for evidence on each dismissal.

### [developing-solidworks](plugins/developing-solidworks)

The only Claude Code skill targeting the SolidWorks .NET COM API. Anti-hallucination guardrails tuned for the low-level surface: many SolidWorks methods take 10–30 positional `bool`/`int`/`double` parameters where a flipped bool silently changes behaviour, so the skill forces named arguments and grounded references to the offline API docs over guesswork. Also: documentation-first workflow, COM-interop code-quality patterns, real-bug learnings (`FeatureCut4` returning null, extrusion failures, faulty-geometry detection), and a `/download-solidworks-docs` command that pulls the offline API doc bundle into the skill folder.
